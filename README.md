# Tindog-Website
Tindog Website (Web Devolopment Frontend Project)

It is a project form AppBrewery and itÂ´s a challenge for every student willing to learn about web development (in this case using html, basic to advanced css and basic to intermediate bootstrap). 

Some links (social media and download buttons) doesnÂ´t work (intentionaly) because it is a fictional app and because of that it doesnÂ´t have a self social media account.

Hope you guys enjoy it and give feedback if you think something should get better. ThereÂ´s a lot of effort in all of this iÂ´ve done so far! 

Thank you!! ğŸ˜Š
